# Impero

Impero is a strategy game written in Go.

The game dynamics revolve around the economic development of a player's own
company empire. Players compete for the control over a tiled map, which has
usually been the Italian peninsula. They have to accumulate the greatest
fortune by carefully managing their companies and buying shares of the
competing ones.

The project was born mainly to have fun with friends. Still a lot of work has
been put into designing the game mechanics and implementation.
As we don't plan any future work on the project, we leave the code open (still
all rights are reserved, check the LICENSE file) as a reference implementation.

The implementation is comprehensive of a web frontend and a Telegram bot used
for notification delivery. Docker scripts are in place for scalable deployment.
